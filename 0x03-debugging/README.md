# 0x03 C - Debugging
C code degugging challenges

## Files 0-main.c, main.h
File 0-main.c tests that function `positive_or_negative()` contained in a separate file gives the correct output when given a case of `0`. File `main.h` contains the prototype of function `positive_or_negative` which is defined in a separate file.

## File 1-main.c
Comment out part of the code causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
