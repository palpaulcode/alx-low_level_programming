# 0x03 C - Debugging
C code degugging challenges

## Files `0-main.c, main.h`
File 0-main.c tests that function `positive_or_negative()` contained in a separate file gives the correct output when given a case of `0`. File `main.h` contains the prototype of function `positive_or_negative` which is defined in a separate file.

## File `1-main.c`
Resolves infinite looping by commenting out part of the code causing the output to go into the infinite loop.

## Files `2-largest_number.c, main.h`
Fix code in `2-largest_number.c` so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers.

## Files `3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h`
Fix function `print_remaining_days` so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
