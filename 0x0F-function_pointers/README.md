# 0x0F C - Function Pointers
This repository contains solutions to coding tasks from the aforementioned section of the C programming course within the ALX_SE program.

## File `0-print_name.c`
This file contains a function that prints a name.
* Prototype: `void print_name(char *name, void (*f)(char *));`

## File `1-array_iterator.c`
This file contains a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array
* Prototype: `void array_iterator(int *array, size_t size, void (*action)(int));`
* where `size` is the size of the array
* and `action` is a pointer to the function you need to use
