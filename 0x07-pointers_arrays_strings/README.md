# 0x07 C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
Contains project tasks on advanced pointers, arrays and strings

## File `0-memset.c`
Contains a function that fills memory with constant byte.

## File `1-memcpy.c`
Copies memory bytes from memory area `src` to memory area `dest`

## File `2-trchr.c`
Locates a character `c` in a string `s` and returns pointer to it or returns `NULL` if the character is not found

## File `3-strspn.c`
Gets the length of a prefix substring

## File `4-strpbrk.c`
Function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

## File `5-strstr.c`
Cotains a function `_strstr()` that finds the first occurence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`. The terminating null bytes are not compared
