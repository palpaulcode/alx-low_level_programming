# 0x01 C - Variables, if, else, while

## Source code for 0x01 C program challenges

## File 0-positive_or_negative.c
Prints whether a randomly generated number is
positive, negative or zero.

## File 1-last_digit.c
This program will assign a random number to the variable `n` each time it is executed.

The variable `n` will store a different value every time you run this program

The output of the program should be:
- The string `Last digit of`, followed by
- `n`, followed by
- the string `is`, followed by
	- if the last digit of `n` is greater than 5: the string `and is greater than 5`
	- if the last digit of `n` is 0: the string `and is 0`
	- if the last digit of `n` is less than 6 and not 0: the string `and is less than 6 and not 0`
- followed by a new line

## File 2-print_alphabet.c
Prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

## File 3-print_alphabets.c
Prints the aplhabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, fllowed by a new line.

## File 4-print_alphabet.c
Prints the alphabet in lowercase except `q` and `e` followed by a new line.

## File 5-print_numbers.c
Prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.

## File 6-print_numberz.c
Write a program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from `0`, followed by a new line.

- You are not allowed to use any variable of type `char`
- You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
- You can only use `putchar` twice in your code
- All your code should be in the `main` function

## File 7-print_tebahpla.c
Write a program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new line.

- You can only use the `putchar` function (every other function (`printf`, `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
- All your code should be in the `main` function
- You can only use `putchar` twice in your code
