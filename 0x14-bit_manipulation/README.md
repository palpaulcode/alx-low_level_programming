# 0x14 C - Bit manipulation
This repository contains solutions to coding tasks from the aforementioned section in the C course within the ALX_SE curriculum

## File `0-binary_to_uint.c`
This file contains a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
* Prototype: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
* where `b` is pointing to a string of `0` and `1` chars
* Return: the converted number, or 0 if
	* there is one or more chars in the string `b` that is not `0` or `1`
	* `b` is `NULL`
