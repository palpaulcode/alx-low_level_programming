# 0x02 C - Functions, nested loops
This directory contains code challenges for the aforementioned section in the ALX SE program

## File 0-putchar.c
Prints string `'_putchar'` using a print method imported from an another file, `putchar.c`, in the same directory as the program.

## File 2-print_alphabet_x10.c
The funtion prints lowercase alphabet ten times using our other programmar declared function `_putchar`.

## File 3-islower.c
The function in this file, `int _islower(int c)` takes one argument of type int, checks whether the letter represented by this argument in ascii chart is lowercase or not. It returns 1 if it's true and 0 otherwise.

## File 4-isalpha.c
This code contains a function, `int _isalpha(int c)`, that checks whether the input character passed as its integer value in ascii table is uppercase or lowercase alphabet.

## File 5-sign.c
Function `int print_sign(int)` in this code prints the sign of a number; + for positive, - for negative, 0 for zero.

## File 6-abs.c
Contains a function, `int _abs(int)` that computes and returns the absolute value of a number.

## File 7-print_last_digit.c
Contains function `int print_last_digit(int)` that prints the last digit of a number passed to it.

## File 8-24_hours.c
This file contains function `void jack_bauer(void)` that prints minutes of the day from 00:00 to 23:59

## File 9-times_table.c
Contains function `void times_table(void)` which prints the 9 times table starting with 0.

## File 10-add.c
Has function `int add(int, int)` that adds two numbers and returns their sum.

## File 11-print_to_98.c
Has a function called `void print_to_98(int n)`. Prints numbers from a given starting number passed as argument to 98. If the parameter is greater than 98, prints from the value of the parameter decrementing by one value until it prints 98 and then stops. If the parameter is less that 98, it prints from the value of the parameter incrementing by one up to 98.

## File 100-times_table.c
File has function called `void print_times_table(int n)` that prints the times table of a given number provided the number is not greater than 15 and not less than 0.

## File 102-fibonacci.c
Prints the first 50 fibonacci numbers

## File 103-fibonacci.c
Prints the sum of fibonacci numbers whose values does not exceed 4,000,000.
